00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
the father of the physio of the edges appeared to me with a voice and spirit song

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:84%
Dear brothers and sisters, today we begin a new cycle of

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.210 align:middle line:84%
catechesis centered on our father the gospels do not present Jesus as

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:84%
a man who prayed while experiencing the urge to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.100 align:middle line:84%
preaching and going out to meet the crowd looking for moments of solitude

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.719 align:middle line:84%
to pray the Gospel of Saint Mark tells us a

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:05.259 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' journey in which he spent all day preaching and curing the sick without

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.760 align:middle line:84%
However the night was dedicated to prayer to go prayer was to enter the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.640 align:middle line:84%
intimacy with the father who supported them in their mission as

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
It happened in Gethsemane where he received the strength to undertake the path of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
cross his whole life was marked by the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.170 align:middle line:84%
both private and liturgical prayer of his people

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.360 align:middle line:84%
and that attitude is also seen in his last words on the cross, which were

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.360 align:middle line:84%
phrases taken from the psalms Jesus prayed like any man but

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.460 align:middle line:84%
his way of doing it was shrouded in mystery

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
this impacted his disciples and that is why they asked him sir teach us to perform

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.450 align:middle line:84%
Jesus thus became a teacher of prayer for them as he wants to be

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.149 align:middle line:84%
also for us

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
cordially greeted the Spanish-speaking pilgrims from Spain and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Latin America the spirits

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:84%
I encourage you to ask God as the disciples did, Lord, teach us to pray

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.440 align:middle line:84%
so that our prayer is neither routine nor selfish but embodied in

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:84%
our life and make it nice to our father

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
God bless you, thank you very much --Applause--

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.820 align:middle line:84%
dear brothers and sisters we continue our reflection on

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
our father jesus teaches this prayer to his disciples it is a prayer

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.010 align:middle line:84%
brief with seven requests number gene in the bible means fullness

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.579 align:middle line:84%
It is also a bold prayer because Jesus invites and invites his disciples to

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:84%
leave fear behind and approach God with filial confidence calling him

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
familiarly

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
our father sinks his roots in the concrete reality of man makes us

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.650 align:middle line:84%
ask what is essential like daily bread because as Jesus teaches us

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.099 align:middle line:84%
Prayer is not something separate from life but begins with the first saint of

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.040 align:middle line:84%
our human existence

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
is present wherever there is a hungry man who cries that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
struggles that suffers and yearns for an answer that will explain fate

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Jesus doesn't want our prayer to be an escape

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.330 align:middle line:84%
I want to present to the father every suffering or concern that we have

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.950 align:middle line:84%
daring to turn it into an invocation shouted with faith

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:36.360 align:middle line:84%
following the example of the blind Bartimaeus, who thanks to his persevering call

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.160 align:middle line:84%
pity of me obtained from the Lord the miracle of regaining sight

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.600 align:middle line:84%
prayer not only precedes salvation but already contains it

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
because it frees you from the despair of believing that the situation is unbearable

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.350 align:middle line:84%
They cannot be resolved, the Lord Jesus give us the grace of total trust in

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
compassionate father god who loves us and always remains by our side who

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.520 align:middle line:84%
our lady of guadalupe help us to surrender to the provident love of god

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and put all our hope in it, thank you very much

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and today we look at the context where the evangelist matthew places this sentence

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.340 align:middle line:84%
which is the discourse of the mountain that story that begins with the

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:45.510 align:middle line:84%
beatitudes summarizes the teaching of jesus and opens precisely by inverting

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:84%
ordinary human categories calling blessed people who

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:57.570 align:middle line:84%
then nor now did they have great prestige in society but they are capable of

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:05.500 align:middle line:84%
love to work for peace and therefore to be builders of the kingdom

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
the law reaches its fulfillment in the mandate of love and love for

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.770 align:middle line:84%
enemies of that love that God teaches us and that leads to the last

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.979 align:middle line:84%
consequences we are children of that god no

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:27.949 align:middle line:84%
super men capable of what no one can do otherwise we are so

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
sinners like the rest but we can stand before the burning bush

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:84%
divine mystery and call him father, letting us renew by his power and

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:48.349 align:middle line:84%
reflect a ray of his goodness in this world thirsty for good and in this

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
context is framed the teaching of father nut

00:06:52.030 --> 00:07:00.700 align:middle line:84%
God does not want to be advanced with long lines of adulation as the

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
pagans to grasp the benevolence of dignity

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.500 align:middle line:84%
just talk to him like a parent who knows what we need even before

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:19.449 align:middle line:84%
tell him in the same way prayer is not an atheistic hypocritical act that has no

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
another interest than to be admired by others the only witness of prayer

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Christianity is one's own conscience because it is an intimate dialogue with the father who

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:84%
loves us I encourage you to always keep

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:43.500 align:middle line:84%
open that channel of communication with God because he loves you and waits for you

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
wants nothing more than to give you his love I wish you and your families a

00:07:50.380 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
new year full of the closeness and tenderness of god thank you very much

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:08.370 align:middle line:84%
dear brothers and sisters our catechesis today makes

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:15.129 align:middle line:84%
reference to the gospel of saint luke from which the three daily signs come

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:22.599 align:middle line:84%
of the liturgy of every day he benedict the magnificat and in a dimitris

00:08:22.599 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and that shows us Jesus in an atmosphere of prayer

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:35.979 align:middle line:84%
Jesus above all is the one praying in every step of his life

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the holy spirit guides you in your actions before making important decisions

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Jesus now dialogues with the father in this gospel he also tells us the

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.779 align:middle line:84%
request of one of the disciples who pleads with jesus to teach him to pray

00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:03.600 align:middle line:84%
Jesus shows you with what words and what feelings you should have to address

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:84%
God does it by teaching our Father the attitudes that the believer

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
must have when now what are perseverance and confidence

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:22.820 align:middle line:84%
perseverance in prayer because although sometimes it seems that God does not

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:30.819 align:middle line:84%
listen, however, it is not like that because no prayer is left unheeded

00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:37.449 align:middle line:84%
To perseverance is added the trust placed in God because he is a

00:09:37.449 --> 00:09:42.360 align:middle line:84%
good father and never forgets his children who suffer

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Prayer changes reality and changes us too

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:55.280 align:middle line:84%
her from now on the victory over loneliness and despair a path that

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.790 align:middle line:84%
God takes us our father who waits for everything and everyone with his arms

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.510 align:middle line:84%
open

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%

may the lord jesus give us the grace to understand that prayer moves the

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:39.490 align:middle line:84%
compassionate heart of god the father who loves us and gives us his holy spirit

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and may the holy virgin help us to be men and women of prayer and trust

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.590 align:middle line:84%
